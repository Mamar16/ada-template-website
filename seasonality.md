# Behaviour during the year: Finding seasonality in ESG and non-ESG ETFs:

Does an energy ETF perform better in winter? Does a travel and leisure ETF work better in summer? These questions will attempt to answer by analysing the effect of seasonality on our ETFs and do patterns reappear every year. The goal of this is to gain more precise information to extend the question of what to invest into to when should I invest in what.

## An overall look

In an attempt to take an eagle-eye peak at the behavior of etfs over the years we first create a heatmap showing the highest average price for each month of all the years we have data for.
